# Products

Currently, we have one working product, which is the msg2task bot. It transforms users' messages into tasks. However, we also have a raw version of an automatic task assigner. The idea of that app is to divide and assign tasks within the team. For example, if you live in a room with four people, and you sometimes have debates about who should throw out the garbage, the Automatic Task Assigner, which we call task2assg, can solve that problem.
